# ✨ .github Repository

The `.github` repository is a **special** repository that affects other repositories within the organization.

## 📚 Resources

If a repository does not have one of these resources defined, the ones from this repository will be used if present:
- 📝 Issue templates
- ✅ Pull request templates
- 📜 Code of conduct
- 🔒 Security policy
- 🏢 Organization profile
- And possibly more!

## 🎯 Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to ensure consistency and efficiency across all repositories in the organization.
